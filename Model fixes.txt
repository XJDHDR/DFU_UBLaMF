==== Known issues ====
	General
		- Due to a bug in Daggerfall Unity ( https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/issues/1706 ) that is caused by loading a save game that was made in a settlement interior location which uses models that I have fixed that was made before installing or updating this mod. If this happens, you can get stuck in that interior. The solution is to make sure don't load a save made in a settlement interior after installing or updating this mod.
		- If you load a save inside a dungeon after installing or updating this mod, any models in that dungeon that I added or changed will disappear from the dungeon map. This is simply the way Daggerfall Unity behaves and the solution is to explore that missing piece of dungeon again. After doing that, the model will render on the map once more.
	
	Model #239
		- There is a visible seam on some of the building's walls. Some texture packs also exasperate the problem. Unfortunately, this can't be fixed by modifying the model but instead needs a fixed texture.
	
	Model #55004 & S0000160.RDB
		- Due to a bug in both Daggerfall Unity and the original game ( https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/issues/1584 ), it is possible to teleport inside Castle Daggerfall and get stuck inside with no way to leave because the magically locked doors are closed. It is possible to open those doors by activating the guard using a gap between the door and it's frame. With this bugfix mod installed, that gap is closed and so, it becomes impossible to escape. 
			- If you manage to get stuck, uninstall this mod temporarily until you have opened those doors (using the method explained here: https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity/issues/1584#issuecomment-568935292 ).
		- One of the magically locked doors is upside down. The fix for this requires a new door model that is inverted.

	LIBRAL03.RMB
		- One container inside the house will still sell books if the player has already identified this building before installing this patch.
	
	TVRNAM00.RMB
		- Innkeeper will still refuse to talk to player if they've already identified this building before installing this patch.
		- If you have already identified either of the inns in this block before installing this patch, they will both have the same name.
