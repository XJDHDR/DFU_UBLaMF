		- Fighters Guild labelled as a temple named "Fighter Trainers". Not in Guilds conversation list.
			- Caused by FIGHBL00.RMB assigning "Temple" to BuildingData Index 1 (line 179 - index #0??) instead of "GuildHall". This propagated to locations using block.
				- Correcting the building type in block file seems to make Temple to Stendarr disappear from conversation menu??

	- Look into replacing the model or somehow changing rotation direction.
		- Also rotated the one door ("ModelIdNum": 55004 - "ModelIndex": 64 - "Position": 22866) as it was upside down.
