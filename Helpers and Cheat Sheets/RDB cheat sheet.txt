To find a specific model in the block:
	1. Find the position of the model in the "ModelReferenceList"
	2. Count which entry the model is in that list. 
		In Notepad++, select that model's entry plus all the ones above. Look for number of lines selected.
		Index number = lines selected / 5 - 1
	3. Count how many of that model is in the block's model list in the editor and which number the one you want to edit is (1st, 2nd, etc)
	4. Search for ["ModelIndex": <index number>,]
	5. The model you are looking for will be the Nth search result.
	
To find a specific sprite/flat in the block:
